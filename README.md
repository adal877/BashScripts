# BashScripts
(May or may not) usefull bash scripts

# Tips
After to download, make sure the script(s) that you wanna use has the executable permissions:

`cd BashScripts && for i in $(ls); do [ -x $i ] && echo "$i -> TRUE" || echo "$i -> FALSE"; done`

This simple code prints the name of the file in the BashScripts directory followed by `TRUE` if the file is executable or `FALSE` if it's not.
